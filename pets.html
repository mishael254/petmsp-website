    <h2>2 .Swimming Dogs</h2>

      <p>Swimming is not just good for your body, but also for your dogs. that is,if your dog likes swimming.Some really dont and would rather stay on land. But there are plenty of ways to make your dog comfortable in the water-its worth the effort though.</p>
      <p>It fun to join your dog in water. A bit different from a walk in the park!</p>
      <p>An added bonus is that dogs need to use more of their muscle power to get around in the water than on land, this is a great way to get dogs in to shape. Regular swimming sessions will help build muscle.The added muscle will help or can help prevent injuries,especially at an older age.At first, your dog maybe hesitant to spend a lot of time swimming,this is quite normal.He or she needs to adjust to water but you should see a gradual increase in time spend swimming.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the pictures of some cute dogs enjoying in water</p>
